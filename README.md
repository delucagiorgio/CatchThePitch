# CatchThePitch

With this web app we aim at helping people internalize musical intervals through a didactic game.

It is structured in a way that is similar to ear training apps, but in this case instead of recognising a given interval, the player is supposed to sing the note distant a given interval from a given root.

## Modes

The game offers the players three modes, some more difficult than others but known to almost everyone, to help them learn at their own pace:

###    Against the Clock

This mode gives the player a fixed amount of time to get the highest amount of intervals correct. [comment]:<>(Maybe add bonus time for correct answer)

###      Arcade Mode

The Arcade Mode gives the player three chances (or lives), after three mistakes the game ends. The goal is the same as before, but if the answer is given
before the time runs out bonus points will be awarded.
be no bonus.

###     Zen Mode

In this mode the player chooses the drill, it is some sort of a training ground. Time doesn't run out, the game goes on as long as the player wants to.
